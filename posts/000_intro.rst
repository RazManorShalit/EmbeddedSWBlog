I Once Worked on a Project
==========================

Who am I?
---------
Hello, my name is Raz. I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience.
Over the course of my career, I have worked mostly in the embedded software industry.
I find this type of programming, and software engineering generally, fascinating and exciting.

What this blog is about
-----------------------
Over the years I developed a personal view on the software world, and embedded programming in particular.
It may not be a unique or original, but it's mine - and therefore I'm in love with it.
In this blog I hope to share my point of view, in hope that you will also find it interesting and exiting.

Who is it for?
--------------
This blog is for any one who is interested in the software world, even not programmers. It is not very technical,
but I'm using terms that may not be familiar to someone who was not exposed in some way to software development.
You don't have to understand everything and you don't have to read everything. Feel free to questions in the comments,
I'll do my best to answer them.

Thank you and have a good time.
