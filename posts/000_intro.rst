Introduction
============

Who am I?
---------
Hello, my name is Raz. I'm a software engeneer with 10+ years of experiance.
I worked for most of my career in the embedded software world.
I find this type of programming, and software engeneering in general interesting and exiting.

What this blog is about
-----------------------
Over the years I developed a personal view on the software world, and embedded programming in particular.
It may not be a unique, or original, but it's mine - and therefore I'm in love with it.
In this blog I hope to share my point of view, in hope that you also find it interesting and exiting.
Since I worked on a lot of projects in my carrier, **I once worked on a project** that demostrait almost anything I'm writing about.

Who is it for?
--------------
This blog is for any one who is interested in the software world, even not programmers. It is not very technical,
but I'm using terms that may not be familier to someone that was not exposed in some way to software development.
You don't have to understand everything, and you don't have to read everything. Please ask questions in the comments,
I'll do my best to answer them and also fix my own mistakes. I'm positive we all can learn from it.

Thank you and have a good time.
