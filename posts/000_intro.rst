I Once Worked on a Project
==========================

Who am I?
---------
Hello, my name is Raz. I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience.
Over the course of my career, I have worked mostly in the embedded software industry.
I find this type of programming, as well as software engineering in general, fascinating and exciting.

What this blog is about
-----------------------
Over the years I developed a personal view on the software world, and embedded programming in particular.
It may not be a unique or original, but it's mine - and therefore I like it.
In this blog I will share my point of view, in hope that you will also find it fascinating and exiting.

Who is it for?
--------------
This blog is for anyone who is interested in the software world, even not programmers. It is not very technical,
but I'm using terms that may not be familiar to someone who was not exposed in some way to software development.
You don't have to understand everything and you don't have to read everything. Feel free to ask questions in the comments,
I'll do my best to answer them.

Thank you and have a good time.
